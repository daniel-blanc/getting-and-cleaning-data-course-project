# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in Coursera.

## The Files
CodeBook.md describes the how to use all of this: the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the necessary code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called secTidySet.txt, also present in this repository.
